During my final masters year, I focused primarily on the Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics, with particular interest in the nature of probability under the Everett (Many-Worlds) interpretation. I also developed a particular interest in the Philosophy of Mind, in particular the nature of consciousness, as well as the intersection between Ethics and science.</p>
