            <br>
            <p>I am a University of Oxford Physics and Philosophy graduate, and in early 2020 I taught myself how to make a website. I fell in love with the unique blend of logical problem solving and creativity that is necessary for good web development. Now, having worked with websites since November 2020, I have come to love optimising and designing efficient processes, and am looking for new opportunities in this area. </p>

During my final masters year, I focused primarily on the Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics, with particular interest in the nature of probability under the Everett (Many-Worlds) interpretation. I also developed a particular interest in the Philosophy of Mind, in particular the nature of consciousness, as well as the intersection between Ethics and science.</p>

            <p>My role at Journey Further is quite different to that of a typical Front End Developer. I work within the Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) team, which runs testing on client websites to ascertain which version customers prefer. My role is to build the tests, primarily using Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, but I also have a number of other responsibilities including: </p>

This might include discussing particular goals and breaking those down into simple changes that can be made to give us vital customer insights, or working with specialists to decide the best way to approach a particular problem.</p>

One example of this was my idea to move to a sprint based development cycle, which significantly reduced the amount of time spent on admin and allowed more of our time to be spent on client work. This has made a significant difference in the number of tests that we are able to produce.</p>

It is incredibly important to me that each of us plays our part to improve the communities we are a part of, and companies both large and small are uniquely placed to make a real difference. To date, we have introduced employee volunteer days, began to look in depth at our environmental impact so that we can ultimately reduce it, and designed an industry-leading charity partner system.</p>
